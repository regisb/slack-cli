slack-cli
=========

‚ö†Ô∏è THIS PROJECT IS IN MAINTENANCE MODE. I have lost interest in Slack -- actually, the less I use Slack the better I feel. Thus I do not have the time nor the energy to make slack-cli compatible with the new Slack authentication mechanism. I will happily review and merge pull requests, though üôÇ If a contributor would like to step forward and start fixing issues, I could then transfer ownership of the project (after they have demonstrated proficiency and integrity).

Effectively interact with `Slack <https://slack.com/>`_ from the command line: send messages, upload files, send command output, pipe content... all from the confort of your terminal.

Member of dozens of Slack teams? No worries, with ``slack-cli`` you can easily switch from one team to another.

Quickstart
==========

::

    $ pip install slack-cli
    $ slack-cli -d general "Hello everyone!"


You will be asked to provide a Slack API token. It's easy, check out the `Tokens`_ section for a quickstart.

Usage
=====

::

    $ slack-cli -h
    usage: slack-cli [-h] [-t TOKEN] [-T TEAM] [-d DST] [-f FILE] [--pre] [--run]
                     [-u USER] [-s SRC] [-l LAST]
                     [messages [messages ...]]

    Send, pipe, upload and receive Slack messages from the CLI

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -t TOKEN, --token TOKEN
                            Explicitly specify Slack API token which will be
                            saved to /home/user/.config/slack-cli/slack_token.
      -T TEAM, --team TEAM  Team domain to interact with. This is the name that
                            appears in the Slack url: https://xxx.slack.com. Use
                            this option to interact with different teams. If
                            unspecified, default to the team that was last used.

    Send messages:
      -d DST, --dst DST     Send message to a Slack channel, group or username
      -f FILE, --file FILE  Upload file
      --pre                 Send as verbatim `message`
      --run                 Run the message as a shell command and send both the
                            message and the command output
      -u USER, --user USER  Send message not as the current user, but as a bot
                            with the specified user name
      messages              Messages to send (messages can also be sent from
                            standard input)

    Receive messages:
      -s SRC, --src SRC     Receive messages from a Slack channel, group or
                            username. This option can be specified multiple times.
                            When streaming, use 'all' to stream from all sources.
      -l LAST, --last LAST  Print the last N messages. If this option is not
                            specified, messages will be streamed from the
                            requested sources.

Sending messages
----------------

The destination argument may be any user, group or channel::

    $ slack-cli -d general "Hello everyone!"
    $ slack-cli -d slackbot "Hello!"

Send message with a different username::

    $ slack-cli -d general -u terminator "I'll be back"

Update status
-------------

::

    $ slack-cli -d general "/status :office: In the office"
    $ slack-cli -d general "/status :house: At home"
    $ slack-cli -d general "/status Just chillin'"
    $ slack-cli -d general "/status clear"

Pipe content from stdin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    $ cat /etc/hosts | slack-cli -d devteam

Usually you will want to format piped content as verbatim content with triple backticks ("\`\`\`"). This is achieved with the ``--pre`` option::

    $ tail -f /var/log/nginx/access.log | slack-cli -d devteam --pre

Upload file
~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    $ slack-cli -f /etc/nginx/sites-available/default.conf -d alice

Run command and send output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is really convenient for showing both the result of a command and the command itself::

    $ slack-cli -d john --run "git log -1"

will send to user ``john``::

    $ git log -1
    commit 013798f5c85043d31f0221a9a32b39298e97fb08

    Date:   Thu Jun 22 15:20:36 2017 +0200

        Replace all commands by a single command

        Our first 1.0 release!

Receiving messages
------------------

Stream to stdout
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Stream the content of a channel::

    $ slack-cli -s general

Monitor all conversations::

    $ slack-cli -s all

Dump (backup) the content of a channel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    $ slack-cli -s general --last 10000 > general.log
    $ slack-cli -s myboss --last 10000 > covermyass.log

Authentication
--------------

Switch to a different team
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Switch to a different team anytime with the ``-T`` flag::

    $ slack-cli -T family -d general "I'll be home in an hour"

The new team will become the new default team.

Token management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note that the Slack token may optionally be stored in an environment variable (although it is not recommended `for security reasons <https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/369566/why-is-passing-the-secrets-via-environmental-variables-considered-extremely-ins>`_)::

    $ export SLACK_TOKEN="slack_token_string"

The ``slack-cli`` configuration is stored in a generic configuration directory -- by default, this is ~/.config/slack-cli on Linux. You can check the path of this directory by running::

    python3 -c "from slackcli.token import CONFIG_ROOT; print(CONFIG_ROOT)"

This directory can be modified by setting the ``SLACK_CLI_CONFIG_ROOT`` environment variable. For instance::

    export SLACK_CLI_CONFIG_ROOT=~/slackcli

Bells and Whistles ·ïï(‚åê‚ñ†_‚ñ†)·ïó ‚ô™‚ô¨
------------------------------

Autocomplete
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Channel, group and user names can be autocompleted from the command line for `bash` users. Add the following line to `~/.bashrc`::

    eval "$(register-python-argcomplete slack-cli)"

Then, try autocompletion with::

    $ slack -s gene<tab>

or::

    $ slack -d <tab><tab>

Unfortunately, I did not manage to get autocompletion to work with ``zsh`` ¬Ø\\_( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)_/¬Ø Please let me know if you have more success.

Colors
~~~~~~

Color output is activated by default in compatible terminals. To deactivate colors, define the ``SLACK_CLI_NO_COLOR`` environment variable::

    export SLACK_CLI_NO_COLORS=1

Emojis
~~~~~~

Emoji short codes will be automatically replaced by their corresponding unicode value. For instance, ``:smile:`` will become üòÑ. However, **these characters will display properly only if your terminal supports them!** I stronly encourage you to download patched fonts from `Nerd Fonts <https://nerdfonts.com/>`_ and to configure your terminal to use them. For instance, in Ubuntu this is how I downloaded the DejaVuSansMono fonts::

    wget -O ~/.fonts/DejaVuSansMono.zip https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/download/v2.0.0/DejaVuSansMono.zip
    cd ~/.fonts
    unzip DejaVuSansMono.zip
    fc-cache -vf ~/.fonts

If emojis are not your thing, you can disable them globally with the ``SLACK_CLI_NO_EMOJI`` environment variable::

    export SLACK_CLI_NO_EMOJI=1

Tokens
~~~~~~

To generate a token, create a `new Slack App <https://api.slack.com/apps/new>`__ and add it to your workspace.

Grant API Permissions to your App, select all that apply (you probably want "chat:write"):

   :alt: Create App and add OAuth Scopes


This is an example of how it could look like:

.. figure:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/regisb/slack-cli/master/docs/scope_example.png
   :alt: Example scopes

Now hit the green ``Install App to workspace`` button, and you will be presented with a token you can use for authentication.
